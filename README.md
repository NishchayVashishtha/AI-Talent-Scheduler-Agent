# AI-Powered Talent Acquisition & Scheduling Agent 🤖📅

This project implements an advanced AI system for automated recruitment and optimized scheduling. It leverages Genetic Algorithms and Expert Systems to match candidates and manage interview states efficiently.

## 🌟 Key Components
* **Genetic Scheduler:** Uses evolutionary algorithms to find the most optimal schedule based on constraints.
* **Resume Parser:** Automates the extraction of key candidate information.
* **Inference Engine:** A knowledge-based system that applies logical rules to candidate data for better decision-making.
* **Search Agent:** Intelligent agent designed for automated candidate searching and filtering.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **AI Concepts:** Genetic Algorithms, Knowledge-Based Systems (Inference Engines), State Management.
* **Framework:** Flask/FastAPI (as seen in `app.py`).
